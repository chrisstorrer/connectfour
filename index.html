<p>How to Play: Connect Four is a game for two players (red and blue). The players alternate turns, dropping a piece of their color in the top of a column. The piece will fall down to the further-down unoccupied slot.</p>
<p>The game is won when a player makes four in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally). The game is a tie if the entire board fills up without a winner.</p><p class="currPlayer">Red Plays First!</p></header>
